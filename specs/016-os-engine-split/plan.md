# Implementation Plan: Split the OS Engine From Business Bootstrap, With Versioned Upgrades

**Branch**: `016-os-engine-split` | **Date**: 2026-07-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/016-os-engine-split/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

> **Bootstrap-order correction (2026-09-24)**: MCP tool choice is not a reliable ordering mechanism; a model may consider `get_inbox`, `get_os_init`, a messaging tool, or a proxied external tool first. The MCP server therefore supplies a protocol-level `instructions` value requiring `read_file` of root `AGENTS.md` before any other task action, and the common tool-registration boundary prepends the same requirement to every native and proxied tool description. This is entirely MCP-side; chat context and chat prompting remain unchanged.

> **Post-launch correction** (research.md §1): the three engine/upgrade/init pieces below were originally shipped as MCP *resources*. Live testing showed a connected assistant has no reliable visibility into MCP resources — it never discovered them, and guessed an unrelated MCP server might be the "engine" instead. They were converted to MCP *tools* (`get_os_engine`, `get_os_upgrade`, `get_os_init`), which the same assistant already used successfully for file operations. This plan is updated in place to reflect the corrected design; research.md keeps the original decision and the correction both, for the record.

Splits today's single, bucket-editable `os/skills/init.md` into three English-only MCP tools served straight from code (`get_os_engine`, `get_os_upgrade`, `get_os_init`) that never appear in the bucket, so the rules governing `AGENTS.md` can't be hand-corrupted (research.md §1-§3). `AGENTS.md` gains an `os-engine-version` integer in its front matter; an owner can ask for an explicit upgrade check, and a repair whose recorded version is behind current shares the same describe-then-confirm gate (Clarifications; FR-002 through FR-006b). Pre-existing (v0) Company OS instances get their inline routing table extracted into a new `os/routing.md` the first time they're touched, rather than losing it (FR-007, FR-008, Story 3). The business-bootstrap interview and everything it produces (`data/*`, `os/identity.md`, policies, domain skills, `os/routing.md`) moves to the `get_os_init` tool, self-triggering whenever `data/` is found missing at the start of any task (FR-011 through FR-014). No new runtime dependency and no new backend parsing/diffing code — version comparison and routing-table extraction are done by the connected assistant reading plain text, the same way it already follows today's `init.md` (research.md §5, §9). The existing `/init` page (specs 014, 015) keeps proving bucket connectivity, capturing the language choice, and writing the same minimal stub `AGENTS.md` it already writes today — it stops writing the one other file it currently copies into the bucket, `os/skills/init.md`, since that content is now MCP-only (research.md §7).

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9 (Next.js 16 App Router, Node.js runtime, React 19) — same as every prior feature in this app.

**Primary Dependencies**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (already installed, already used for tools via `mcp-handler`'s `createMcpHandler`) — this feature adds three more `registerTool` calls (`frontend/lib/mcp-tools/engineTools.ts`) alongside the existing ones in `frontend/lib/mcp-tools/index.ts`. Existing `frontend/lib/storage/*` (`readFile`/`createFile`/`hasAnyObjectWithPrefix`, unchanged) and `frontend/lib/os/init.ts` (revised, contracts/init-skeleton.md). No new npm dependency (research.md §9).

**Storage**: S3-compatible object storage (MinIO, spec 001) for the bucket-side entities (`AGENTS.md`, `os/routing.md`, `data/*`, etc.); the three engine/upgrade/init tool outputs are code-bundled Markdown, never stored in the bucket (data-model.md).

**Testing**: No automated test suite in this project; validated via `quickstart.md`'s manual scenario walkthrough, consistent with specs 001-015.

**Target Platform**: Linux server / local dev; same Next.js Route Handler (`frontend/app/mcp/route.ts`) already hosting the MCP tool surface (specs 002, 008, 010, 011, 013), plus the existing `/init` page (specs 014, 015).

**Project Type**: web — single Next.js app (`frontend/`); this feature adds one new lib subdirectory (`lib/os/engine/`), a small `registerTool`-based addition to `lib/mcp-tools/`, and shrinks the existing `lib/os/templates/<lang>/` pair down to an `AGENTS.md`-only stub per language.

**Performance Goals**: No new targets — the three tool outputs are read once at module load (mirrors `lib/os/init.ts`'s existing `SKELETON_TEMPLATES` pattern) and served from memory; the assistant-side version comparison/routing extraction is a normal chat turn, not a new request path with its own latency budget.

**Constraints**: The three engine/upgrade/init tools' content MUST NOT be reachable through any file-system tool (`list_directory`/`read_file`/etc.) — enforced structurally by never writing them to the bucket (FR-001, SC-003). Repair and upgrade MUST share one confirm-before-change gate, never two independent paths (Clarifications, FR-006a/FR-006b). The business-data check MUST run every task, not once per session (FR-012a, Clarifications). The three tools MUST actually be discoverable/callable by a connected assistant in practice, not just in principle — the reason this feature uses MCP tools rather than resources (research.md §1, post-launch correction).

**Scale/Scope**: Same low-volume, single-owner scale as every prior Company OS feature (014, 015) — one engine version number and one routing file per Company OS instance, not a multi-tenant concern.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

`.specify/memory/constitution.md` is still the unfilled template (all sections are placeholders — no ratified principles exist for this project), same as every prior feature in this repo. No gates apply; nothing to check against. Re-confirmed after Phase 1: still N/A.

```

**Structure Decision**: Stays entirely inside the existing single Next.js app (`frontend/`) established by specs 001-015 — no new project or top-level directory. Adds one new lib subdirectory (`lib/os/engine/`, the three code-bundled tool-output sources) and one new module (`lib/mcp-tools/engineTools.ts`) alongside the existing tool registration; the six per-language `templates/<lang>/init.md` files are removed rather than replaced, since their content now lives once, in English, under `lib/os/engine/init.md`.
