# Specification Quality Checklist: Split the OS Engine From Business Bootstrap, With Versioned Upgrades

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All decisions in this spec were converged through prior discussion with the user (engine as an MCP-only resource, routing file kept under `os/` not `data/`, simple staleness check for triggering business setup, English-only engine internals with owner-facing text staying localized) — no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed.
- Mentions of "MCP", "resource", "bucket" in the user's original request were deliberately translated to technology-agnostic language in this spec ("OS provider's connection", "storage location") per spec-writing guidelines; the `plan.md` phase is where these map back to the project's actual MCP-based implementation.
- Revalidated 2026-09-24 after adding the mandatory `AGENTS.md` task-bootstrap story and FR-016–FR-019: all checklist items remain satisfied and no clarification markers were introduced.
- Revalidated 2026-09-24 after strengthening advisory bootstrap guidance into the enforceable FR-020–FR-022 gate: all checklist items remain satisfied and no clarification markers were introduced.
