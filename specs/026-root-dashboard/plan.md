# Implementation Plan: Root Dashboard Page

**Branch**: `026-root-dashboard` | **Date**: 2026-08-05 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/026-root-dashboard/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit-plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

`/` currently has no `app/page.tsx`, so it 404s once storage is configured. Add a server-rendered dashboard at `frontend/app/page.tsx` that lists a link to every existing top-level page (Files, Tools, Settings › Connected Apps, Settings › Personal Access Tokens), following the same conventions already used by `app/tools/page.tsx` and the settings pages (inline styles, `resolveLanguage()` + `getDictionary()` for text; each link's destination continues to also enforce its own existing session check). The link list is a small, centrally-maintained array co-located with the page rather than an automatically generated route scan, since Next.js App Router has no runtime API to enumerate pages.

**Follow-up (2026-09-02)**: the dashboard originally shipped with no auth gate of its own (this
Summary said so above). Reversed after the owner found an unauthenticated visitor to `/` could see
the full admin section list before signing in — see spec.md's Follow-up section and research.md §3.
`frontend/app/page.tsx` now starts with the same `hasActiveOwnerSession()` +
`redirect("/oauth/login?continue=/")` check every other top-level page already uses, before
resolving the dictionary or rendering `DASHBOARD_LINKS`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.9.3, React 19.2.7

**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16.2.10 (App Router, Server Components); existing `lib/i18n` (`resolveLanguage`, `getDictionary`) and `lib/oauth/session` (`hasActiveOwnerSession`, used by linked pages and, as of the 2026-09-02 follow-up, by the dashboard itself)

**Storage**: N/A — the dashboard's link list is static data in code; no persisted state is read or written

**Testing**: No automated test suite is configured in this repository (no test runner in `frontend/package.json`); validation is manual via `quickstart.md`, consistent with existing features in this repo

**Target Platform**: Web — server-rendered page in the existing self-hosted Next.js frontend (harness-mcp)

**Project Type**: Web application — single Next.js app under `frontend/` (no separate backend project; API routes live inside the same app)

**Performance Goals**: None beyond standard page-load expectations for a static server-rendered link list (no data fetching beyond language resolution)

**Constraints**: Must reuse existing UI conventions (inline styles matching `app/tools/page.tsx` and `app/settings/*`) rather than introducing a new design system; must not duplicate or bypass each linked page's existing access control

**Scale/Scope**: One new page, four link entries (Files, Tools, Settings › Connected Apps, Settings › Personal Access Tokens), plus one new `dashboard` namespace across the six existing locale dictionaries (`en`, `it`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `ru`)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

`.specify/memory/constitution.md` is still the unfilled template (no principles have been ratified for this project). There are no project-specific gates to evaluate; this plan follows the repository's observed conventions instead (see Technical Context and research.md).

        └── index.ts                   # existing — no change
```

**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js App Router project (`frontend/`), matching every prior spec in this repo (001–025). No backend/frontend split and no new top-level directory are needed — this feature is one new page file plus dictionary additions in the existing `lib/i18n` module.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
No violations — the Constitution Check identified no gates to satisfy, and this feature adds a single page plus dictionary entries with no new project, service, or architectural pattern.
