 * route fail on its own first storage call.
 *
 * Deliberately a cheap env-var presence check, not a live connectivity
 * probe (that would cost a network round trip on every request) — this
 * only catches "nothing set at all." A reachable-but-wrong config
 * (unreachable endpoint, rejected credentials, missing bucket) isn't
 * redirected here; visiting /init directly still shows the full,
