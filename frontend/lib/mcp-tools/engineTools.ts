/**
 * English-only, code-bundled engine content (spec 016) — never written into
 * the bucket, never reachable via list_directory/read_file (SC-003). Read
 * once at module load, with every path spelled out literally (mirrors
 * lib/os/init.ts's SKELETON_TEMPLATES) so Vercel's build-time file tracing
 * (`@vercel/nft`) bundles all three files.
 *
 * Originally shipped as MCP *resources* (registerResource) — reverted after
 * live testing showed a connected assistant can reliably discover and call
 * MCP *tools* (it already used list_directory/read_file without issue) but
 * had no visibility into resources at all: it didn't know they existed and
 * guessed a completely unrelated, separately-connected MCP server might be
 * the "engine" AGENTS.md's stub vaguely pointed at. Tools are what's
 * actually supported consistently across MCP clients; the tradeoff (sharing
 * a namespace with create_file/read_file/etc.) is worth that reliability.
