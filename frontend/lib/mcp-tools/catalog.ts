/**
 * The full list of MCP tools this server can register, independent of
 * whether any given one is currently enabled (spec 024-tools-status-page
 * research.md §1). A disabled tool is never registered on the live
 * McpServer (spec 023), so this list can't be derived by introspecting a
 * server instance — it must be kept in sync by hand with the
 * `register*Tools` calls in this directory. The canonical list lives in
 * ../../../specs/023-mcp-tool-toggle/contracts/mcp-tool-toggle-config.md.
